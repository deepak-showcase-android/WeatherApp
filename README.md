# WeatherApp

## How to see weather info
1. Connect device to the internet
2. Tap on Weather tab

## How to build and run the app
1. Clone the code
   (git clone git@github.com:deepak-showcase-android/WeatherApp.git)
2. Build and run either on emulator or on real device 

## Technical debt
1. Create mock flavor, add mock classes (MockOpenWeatherRemoteDataSource.kt)
2. Add mock data in the mock file to simulate weather data
3. Write Unit and UI tests
